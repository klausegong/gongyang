**Abstract:** 
  Taiwan's HELs has been in fierce competition and suffered from
  teaching quality deterioration since last century, mainly due to the
  policy encouraging the establishment of university conducted by the
  authority, thus we applies the Meta-Frontier Cost Malmquist
  Productivity Gap Index to analyze the performances and productivity
  index in the HELs of Taiwan. Recently, the researchers are indulging
  themselves in deducing the cause of differences in efficiency and
  productivity, there are few systematic estimations and discussions
  regarding the margin of the technology gap which lead to the different
  productivity which is regarded not only as a key information to
  inspect the efficiency of higher education, but also can be taken to
  direct the higher education reform. The main purpose of this paper is
  to capture the performance and efficiency of higher education of
  Taiwan so as to present a reliable reform guiding to the conductor of
  HELs of Taiwan. Statistical results based on date for 49 public
  universities and 96 private universities Taiwan's HELs for 2015 to
  2017, the all sample CMPG (1.027) means an improvement in groups
  productivity and group cost frontier converges to Meta cost frontier
  at the speed of 2.7%, and the group technology convergence effect
  mainly comes from public HELs. Besides ,as for the specific group, the
  values of CMGP HELs in public and private are both greater than 1 ,
  indicate both of which have an improvement in cost-oriented
  productivity of them.

# Introduction

The quantity of university in Taiwan experienced rapid growth during the
past two decades, mainly because of Taiwan authority encouraging the
establishment of university. Taiwan has promoted university enrollment
expansion policy since 1997, particularly, when in the era of Chen
Shui-bian , the policy was even extended to "one county, one university"
which resulted in the number of colleges and universities increased
madly, reaching more than 160 at its peaks. The rapid expansion of
university without hesitation has led to part of those universities are
of poor quality and lack of features . Besides, due to the promotion of
Taiwan's educational diversification policy and the liberalization of
the education market, Taiwan's higher education has gradually changed
from the elite education to the popular education, from the education
statistics of the Ministry of Education that the net enrollment rate of
higher education in Taiwan has reached 71.24% from 38.7% in 2000 to
2016, which led to the quality of teaching in universities further
declined. At the same time, since Taiwan's accession to the WTO in 2002,
due to the principle of equality and reciprocity which means foreign
educational institutions can also set up branch campuses in Taiwan has
further increased the number of universities in Taiwan. Along with the
boom of university, Taiwan has seen the trend of fewer children since
1990s, according to the statistic of Taiwan Ministry of the Interior
Statistics Office , the number of births in Taiwan has dropped from more
than 260,000 in 2001 to only 160,000 in 2010. The low fertility rate
directly reflects in the registration rate of higher education in
Taiwan, referring to data released by the Taiwan Education Department at
the end of 2017, 17 schools in all 157 colleges and universities in
Taiwan suffered a registration rate of less than 60 and the trend of
declining birthrate, whether colleges and universities have the ability
to effectively apply limited resources to operate themselves and apply
the least resources to achieve the most efficient output is now
particularly urgent.

Taiwan's HELs mainly made up by four part, public universities, private
universities, and general universities and technical colleges, Cohn et
al (1989) and RKKoshal et al (1999) suggested the cost and output
relationship must make adjustments for various Outputs and for quality
variations among institutions which means that we can't take all HELs as
one homogeneous unit when we conduct performance analysis, instead, we
should take into account the differences among HELs quality.In term of
Battesse et al(2008)different sets of feasible input-output combinations
or so-called technology sets have led efficiency researchers to estimate
separate production frontiers for different groups of firms. In light of
this, to investigate the efficiency among HELs in Taiwan is essential to
use metafrontier framework.

The purpose of this paper is to estimate the cost efficiency of HELs of
Taiwan among different types, referring to which the conductors of HELs
can improve the quality of the HELs to attain a better operation
condition under the fiscal competition circumstance. The structure of
the paper is as followed. In Sect.2, a literature review will be conduct
with a table summarize the output and input used in previous work. In
Sect3, the theoretical concept of meta-frontier approach will be
presented to demonstrate the approach applied in this paper. Then,
Sect.4 will contains a discussion of our date and variables as well as
empirical results. Our main conclusions will be summarized in final
section.

# Literiture

Meta-frontier frameworks is derived from the metaproduction function
which was first introduced by Hayami(1969) and Hayami et al(1970)
applied to the agricultural productivity. Based on the hypothesis that
different groups have the potential access to the same technology,
numbers of works have been showing up to develop the methodology since
then. Gunratne and Leung(2001)extended the metaproduction function,
where define it as an envelope of all neoclassical production functions
where producers are on different micro-production functions due to the
differences in adoption and diffusion of technology, to the stochastic
metaproduction frontier. Battesse et al(2002) and Battesse et al(2004)
extended the SFA approach to the estimation of meta-frontier, Battesse
et al(2008) especially overcomed the problem that in his previous work
only consider estimation of the meta-frontier using one type of SFA
methodology by extending the framework to consider both of DEA and SFA
method. Along with the meta-frontier framework development, the
meta-frontier framework has seen many applications in different fields,
for example, Lovell and Pastor(1997)apply it for bank branches in Spain
along with target setting, Mundlak et al(1982) and Lau et al(1989)apply
it to compare agricultural productivity among countries, Binam et
al(2008) use the approach to the Cocoa industry among countries in
Africa, and Boshrabadi et al(2008) investigate the separate groups
efficiency of Iranian wheat growers, Rungsuriyawiboon et al(2007)discuss
the agricultural efficiency and productivity in China. From the examples
above, it can be seen that the meta-frontier framework is currently
widely applied in agriculture and finance, and the application of
meta-frontier in evaluating the efficiency of higher education
institutions and analyzing the productivity index of it still counted
minority.

Hooshang Izadi(2002)derive and maximize the likelihood function
associated with the problem that the standard software packages do not
allow stochastic frontier estimation in the constant elasticity of
substitution (CES) function and hence construct measures of economies of
scale and scope which obtain in British higher education. The study uses
the half-normal residuals generated by the stochastic frontier
estimation to construct measures of technical efficiency for each
university in our sample.

Gerhard Kempkes (2006) analyze the efficiency of 72 public German
universities for the years 1998-2003, applying data envelopment and
stochastic frontier analysis. Contrary to earlier studies they account
for the faculty composition of universities, which proves to be an
essential element in the efficiency of higher education. Their main
finding is that East German universities have performed better in total
factor productivity change compared to those in West Germany. However,
when looking at mean efficiency scores over the sample period, West
German universities still appear at the top end of relative efficiency
outcomes.

Jill Johnes (2006) explores the advantages and drawbacks of the various
methods for measuring efficiency in the higher education context and
conduct an application of DEA to a data set of more than 100 HEIs in
England using data for the year 2000/01. The finding shows that
technical and scale efficiency in the English higher education sector
appears to be high on average.

Tommaso Agasisti(2015) applies a procedure developed by Wang and Ho
(2010), for estimating the efficiency in Italian higher education
through a multi-output parametric distance function, so as to deal with
the problem that efficiency scores may lead to biased efficiency
estimates for suffering from the presence of incidental parameters or
time-invariant. The study shows that models which do not consider
unobservable heterogeneity tend to estimate higher efficiency scores.
The findings provide a clue towards the expansion of pro-competitive
policies in the Italian higher education sector, consistently with the
interpretation that when market forces operate, there are benefits for
university efficiency. When exploring differences in universities'
performances, by geographical areas, they claim that maintaining
State-level policies can be detrimental for overall efficiency, and
instead,special interventions for universities in the South should be
designed.

Min Hee Kim(2016)uses data envelopment analysis (DEA) to examine and
compare internationally the relative efficiency of higher education. the
contraction model was established with three input variables and three
output variables. Output maximization was used to analyze the model.
Presupposing variable return to scale, the DEA efficiency value of
twelve OECD countries was evaluated. Testing the number of references
set for each country, the efficient country was identified. Evaluating
the potential improvement-possibility value, the inefficient factor was
also investigated. The efficiency scores of each country appeared very
different. Factors affecting the efficiency of HEIs are of a great
number, yet, we can determine the factors we concerned from the
literature, referring the reasons why they are picked as well as the
definition of the variable. We summarize the input and output that other
scholars chose in their paper on the table followed.

# Methodology

## Meta Cost Malmquist Productivity Index

Assume that the Taiwan HELs are divided into j groups, set j=1,2, . . .
,J. The k-th HELs of j -th group utilizes N inputs for producing M
outputs, set t=1,2, . . . ,T to express the period t . The vector of
inputs is $x^t\in\Re_+^N$, and the vector of outputs is
$y^t\in\Re_+^M$.


So, the production possibility set of the j-th group and Meta-frontier
at the period t can be expressed as follows: 

$$\begin{split}
P^t_j=\{(x^t,y^t)|x^t\textrm{ can produce } y^t\}\\
P^t_*=conv\{(x^t,y^t)|x^t \textrm{ can produce } y^t\}
\end{split}$$

So, input requirement set of the j-th group and Meta-frontier at the
period t can be expressed as follows: 
$$\begin{split}
L^t_j(y^t)=\{x^t|(x^t,y^t)\in{P^t_j}\}\\
L^t_*(y^t)=\{x^t|(x^t,y^t)\in{P^t_\ast}\}
\end{split}$$

$L^t(y^t)$is a closed, bounded and convex set, and the inputs and
outputs have strong disposability. For the$(x^t,y^t)$, the input
distance function of the j-th group and Meta-frontier (Shepherd, 1970;
Färe, 1988; Färe et al., 1994) is defined at time t as: $$\begin{split}
D^t_j(y^t,x^t)=\underset{\theta}{sup}\{\theta|(x^t/\theta)\in{}L^t_j(y^t),\theta>0\}\\
D^t_*(y^t,x^t)=\underset{\theta}{sup}\{\theta|(x^t/\theta)\in{}L^t_*(y^t),\theta>0\}
\end{split}$$

The input distance functions of the j-th HELs group and Meta-frontier
for input-oriented measurement are defined as $D^t_j(x^t,y^t)$ and
$F^t_*(x^t,y^t)$, respectively. This input distance function by Farrell
(1957) is the reciprocal of the input-oriented technical efficiency,
$\textrm{TE}_\textrm{I}$. So, input-oriented technical efficiency of the
j-th group and Meta-frontier at the period t can be expressed as follow:

$$\begin{split}
TE^t_j(y^t,x^t)=\frac{1}{D^t_j(y^t,x^t)}\leq1\\
TE^t_*(y^t,x^t)=\frac{1}{D^t_*(y^t,x^t)}\leq1
\end{split}$$

Battese and Rao (2002) provided a conception frame by Meta-frontier,
define Meta-frontier to be a frontier that be consist of a group of
unrestricted technical collection, group-frontiers are many frontiers
that be consist of many frontiers that be consist of many groups of
restricted technical collections, the restriction is the gap that caused
by technical knowledge or other features of physics, society , law and
economy, Meta-frontier always envelop group frontiers. Technology gap is
the measurement of the distance between group-frontiers and
Meta-frontier. Accordingly j group and TG of Meta can be represented as:

$$TG^t_j(y^t,x^t)=\frac{D^t_j(y^t,x^t)}{D^t_*(y^t,x^t)}\leq1$$

In addition,the technology gap ratio(TG)can be shown be identical to the
technical efficiency gap(TEG) ratio as follow,
$$TEG^t_j(y^t,x^t)=\frac{TE^t_j(y^t,x^t)}{TE^t_*(y^t,x^t)}=TG^t_j(y^t,x^t)$$

In the spirit of the conventional Malmquist productivity index, assuming
two time periods t and t+1 respectively, the Malmquist productivity gap
(MPG) over two time periods can be defined as the geometric mean of the
technology gap ratio (TG) in two periods for the sake of avoiding an
arbitrary choice of a reference period with reference to alternative
technology, so $MPG_j$ is presented as follow:
$$MPG_j=[\frac{TG^t_{j}(y^{t+1})}{TG^t_{j}(y^t)}\times{}\frac{TG^{t+1}_{j}(y^{t+1})}{TG^{t+1}_{j}(y^t)}]^{1/2}\\$$

Thus, when the MPG is greater than 1 it indicates convergence in
productivity growth toward meta-frontier. The MPG less than one implies
divergence and stationary is signaled by MPG equal to 1.

As in the Malmquist productivity index, the MPG can also be decomposed
as follow:
$$MPG_j=\frac{TG^{t+1}_{j}(y^{t+1})}{TG^t_{j}(y^t)}\times{}[\frac{TG^t_{j}(y^t)}{TG^{t+1}_{j}(y^t)}\times{}\frac{TG^t_{j}(y^{t+1})}{TG^{t+1}_{j}(y^{t+1})}]^{1/2}\\$$

The component outside the bracket is the ratio of technology gaps (or
the ratio of technical efficiency gaps) in two periods which is called
the technical efficiency gap change ($\Delta TEG_{j}$) as follow:
$$\Delta TEG_{j}=\frac{TEG^{t+1}_j(y^{t+1},x^{t+1})}{TEG^t_j(y^t,x^t)}=\frac{TG^{t+1}_j(y^{t+1})}{TG^t_j(y^t)}$$

In a similar fashion ,the $\Delta TEG_{j}$ implies convergence in
productivity growth toward meta-frontier when it is greater than 1,while
it less than 1 indicates divergence and stationary comes to the
situation that equal to 1.

The component inside the bracket is defined in terms of two TG ratios
which compare TGs of producing a given output facing different
technology at $t^{th}$ and $(t+1)^{th}$ periods. It measures the
convergence in technology gap due to technical change, that is,
$$\Delta TG_j=[\frac{TG^t_{j}(y^t)}{TG^{t+1}_{j}(y^t)}\times{}\frac{TG^t_{j}(y^{t+1})}{TG^{t+1}_{j}(y^{t+1})}]^{1/2}\\$$

Thus, when the $\Delta TG_{j}$ is greater than 1 it indicates
convergence in productivity growth toward meta-frontier. The
$\Delta TG_{j}$ less than one implies divergence and stationary is
signaled by $\Delta TG_{j}$ equal to 1.In sum, we have,
$$\Delta MPG_{j}=\Delta TEG_{j}\times{}\Delta TG_j$$

## Cost Malmquist Productivity Gap

On the basis of input distance function, plus the price restriction of
input elements can get optimal cost of producing y, accordingly,
correspond to output vector $y^t\in\Re^m_+$. and input vector price
vector $w^t\in\Re^n_+$, in the condition of t section reference
technology, the assessed bank group jth and the cost function of
Meta-frontier can be represented as :

$$\begin{split}
C^t_j(y^t,w^t)={x^t}_t{min}\{w^tx^t|(x^t,y^t)\in{}P^t_j,w^t>0\}\\
C^t_*(y^t,w^t)={x^t}_t{min}\{w^tx^t|(x^t,y^t)\in{}P^t_*,w^t>0\}
\end{split}$$

Further, we can define the cost gap, the ratio of the two cost
frontiers, which measures the relative cost adopted technology to the
meta-technology as follow,
$$CG^t_j(y^t,w^t)=\frac{C^t_*(y^t,w^t)}{C^t_j(y^t,w^t)}\leq1$$

When the DMU's (in this paper referring to the university) observed
output with input at time t, it is easy to show that the cost gap is
identical to the ratio of cost efficiencies,
$$CEG^t_j(y^t,x^t,w^t)=\frac{CE^t_*(y^t,x^t,w^t)}{CE^t_j(y^t,x^t,w^t)}=\frac{C^t_*(y^t,w^t)/w^tx^t}{C^t_j(y^t,w^t)/w^tx^t}=\frac{C^t_*(y^t,w^t)}{C^t_j(y^t,w^t)}=CG^t_j(y^t,w^t)$$

With the reference to (7), the cost Malmquist productivity gap (CMPG)
over two time periods, t and t+1, can be defined as the geometric mean,
$$CMPG_j=[\frac{CG^t_{j}(y^{t+1},w^t)}{CG^t_{j}(y^t,w^t)}\times{}\frac{CG^{t+1}_{j}(y^{t+1},w^{t+1})}{CG^{t+1}_{j}(y^t,w^{t+1})}]^{1/2}\\$$

Here, when the $CMPG_j$ is greater than 1 it implies convergence in cost
frontier toward meta cost frontier. The $CMPG_j$ less than one implies
divergence and stationary shows up only when the $CMPG_j$ is equal to 1.

With reference to (8), the CMPG can be decomposed as
$$CMPG_j=\frac{CG^{t+1}_{j}(y^{t+1},w^{t+1})}{CG^t_{j}(y^t,w^t)}\times{}[\frac{CG^t_{j}(y^t,w^t)}{CG^{t+1}_{j}(y^t,w^{t+1})}\times{}\frac{CG^t_{j}(y^{t+1},w^t)}{CG^{t+1}_{j}(y^{t+1},w^{t+1})}]^{1/2}\\$$

The component outside the bracket is the ratio of cost gaps (or the
ratio of cost efficiency gaps) in two periods which is called the cost
efficiency gap change ($\Delta CEG_{j}$),that is
$$\Delta CEG_{j}=\frac{CEG^{t+1}_{j}(y^{t+1},x^{t+1},w^{t+1})}{CEG^t_{j}(y^t,x^t,w^t)}=\frac{CG^{t+1}_{j}(y^{t+1},w^{t+1})}{CG^t_{j}(y^t,w^t)}\\$$

Here, when the $\Delta CEG_{j}$ is greater than 1 it implies convergence
in cost efficiency toward meta cost frontier. The $\Delta CEG_{j}$ less
than one implies divergence and stationary shows up only when the
$\Delta CEG_{j}$ is equal to 1.

The component inside the bracket is defined in terms of two CG ratios
which compare CGs of producing an identical output facing different
technology at $t^{th}$ and $(t+1)^{th}$ periods. It measures the
convergence in cost gap due to technical change,

$$\Delta CTG_j=[\frac{CG^t_{j}(y^t,w^t)}{CG^{t+1}_{j}(y^t,w^{t+1})}\times{}\frac{CG^t_{j}(y^{t+1},w^t)}{CG^{t+1}_{j}(y^{t+1},w^{t+1})}]^{1/2}\\$$

Thus, when the index of $CTG_{j}$ greater than 1 implies the catching-up
or convergence, while $CTG_{j}$ less than 1 implies divergence, and
$CTG_{j}$ equal to 1implies stationary. In sum, we have,

$$CMPG_{j}=\Delta CEG_{j}\times{}\Delta CTG_{j}$$

Parallel to Maniadakis and Thanassoulis (2004) , we can further
decompose $$\Delta CEG_{j}=\Delta TEG_{j}\times{}\Delta AEG_{j}\\
%\Delta CTG_{j}=\Delta TG_{j}\times{}\Delta PEG_{j}\\$$
$$\Delta CTG_{j}=\Delta TG_{j}\times{}\Delta PEG_{j}\\$$
where$\Delta AEG_{j}$ means allocative efficiency gap change and
$\Delta PEG_{j}$ means price effect gap change.

## The Estimation of CMPG Scores

Firstly, this study uses Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to estimate the
group Meta-frontier efficient of universities in public school and
private school. Base on the group Meta-frontier cost efficient value,
denoted as $CE_{j}$ , this study figures out the Meta-frontier cost
efficient value of selected universities and colleges which is denoted
as CE\*. Finally, productivity gap index is calculated via
$CE^{*}/ CE_{j}$ ,which is denoted as $CG_{j}$ . All values are
presented in the form of reciprocal. All efficient values are between 0
and 1. The 1 represents the most efficient situation, and vice versus.
The gap between value 0 and 1 mean what extent can the university or
college improve its efficiency with the output level constant.

The average value of cost efficiencies of meta-frontier ,different
groups and cost gap for the entire period 2015-2017 are summarized in
Table 4.From the index presented in Table 4, with respect to the result
of different types of HELs, on average, the private HELs is apparently
conducting under a less satisfied condition that is more restrictive
than in the public HELs--the average cost efficiency index (0.674)
suggests that private HELs could, at best, produce only 67% of the
output that could be produced using the(unrestricted) meta-technology.
The average index for public HELs (0.893) suggests that public HELs
could produce about 89% of the output that could be produced using the
meta-technology (under the same cost condition). Meanwhile, the all
sample $CE_{j}$ (0.745) indicates that there is 25.5% (1-0.745)
potential to be reduced so as to reach the most efficient condition in
light of the cost. Observe from the date in column 3 of Table 4, which
is based on the meta-frontier, the index of all sample (0.682), on
average, indicates that in order to reach the most efficient condition,
the HELs tested is required to deduce 31.8%. Moreover, compared the cost
efficiencies of meta-frontier and group frontier between public HELs and
private HELs, one can figure out that the private HELs is in a worse
condition than the public HELs of both. However, the cost gap of public
HELs(0.792) is smaller compared to private HELs(0.995), indicates that
the distance between the cost frontier of public HELs and cost
meta-frontier is greater than the private one.

Based on the analysis above, we further applied the concept of Battese
and Rao(2002)meta-frontier to reconstruct the decompose approach of CM
presented in Maniadakis and Thanassoulis (2004) to establish the
Meta-CM-Productivity Gap Index (Meta-CM-PG) model. In a similar fashion,
Meta-CM-PG(meta-CM-productivity gap index)is available to decompose into
$\Delta CEG$ and $\Delta CTG$ two parts, notation as
above,$CMPG_{j}=CEG_{j}\times CTG_{j}$ .According to the definition of
$CMPG_{j}$ ,the index of it is greater than 1 implies convergence in
cost frontier toward meta cost frontier. The $CMPG_{j}$ less than one
implies divergence and stationary shows up only when the $CMPG_{j}$is
equal to 1. The index of $CMPG_{j}$ and the components of it are
summarized in Table 5. As with the result for the all sample CMPG
(1.027), it can be noted that the CMPG is greater than 1,which means an
improvement in groups productivity and group cost frontier converges to
Meta cost frontier at the speed of 2.7%. Among the improvement, mainly
due to the group technology convergence effect from public HELs which
converge on meta-frontier with an average rate of 7%, whereas the
private HELs merely holds a slight convergence with the value of 1.006.
Furthermore, information about CMPG converges to Meta cost frontier can
be calculated by decomposing the Meta-Frontier Cost Malmquist
Productivity Gap Index, results in the table 5 are $\Delta CEG_{j}$
(1.012) and $\Delta CTG_{j}$ (1.008), which mean group cost efficient
frontier converge to meta cost frontier.

When analyzing the specific group, the values of CMGP HELs in public and
private are both greater than 1, indicating the two groups cost frontier
of HELs in Taiwan converge to Meta cost frontier, showing an improvement
in cost-oriented productivity of them. The technical efficient of public
HELs of Taiwan are showing convergence at an average speed of 7.6% (
$\Delta CTG_{j}$=1.076), whereas the private HELs shows divergence at an
average speed of 1.8%( $\Delta CTG_{j}$=0.982).

Last but not least, the $\Delta CTG_{j}$ for HELs in Taiwan, the index
of which are 0.995 and 1.015.The former is less than 1, indicating the
efficiency of public HELs is facing sluggish or regress, while the
latter is greater than 1 in term of an improvement existing in technical
gap of private HELs of Taiwan.

# Conclusion

For the purpose of estimating the cost efficiency in HELs of Taiwan
among different types, in this paper referring to public HELs and
private HELs two types, we applied the meta-frontier framework combined
with Cost Malmquist Productivity Index (CMPI) , Meta-CM-Productivity Gap
Index (Meta-CM-PG),to compare the efficiencies of them, which we hope
the empirical results and the conclusions can be available to the
conductor of HELs as a reference material when adjusting the policy or
operating strategy . Thus, we use data on Taiwan universities and
colleges for the years 2015-2017 to estimate the cost efficiency and the
Meta-CM-productivity gap index between them. The empirical results
indicate some meaningful conclusions. They are stated as follow.

I. With respect to the result of different types of HELs, on average,
the private HELs is apparently conducting under a less satisfied
condition that is more restrictive than in the public HELs--the average
cost efficiency index (0.674) suggests that private HELs could, at best,
produce only 67% of the output that could be produced using
the(unrestricted) meta-technology. The average index for public HELs
(0.893) suggests that public HELs could produce about 89% of the output
that could be produced using the meta-technology (under the same cost
condition). Meanwhile, the all sample $CE_{j}$(0.745) indicates that
there is 25.5% potential to be reduced so as to reach the most efficient
condition in light of the cost.

II\. Based on the meta-frontier, the index of all sample is 0.682, on
average, indicates that in order to reach the most efficient condition,
the HELs tested is required to deduce 31.8%. Moreover, compared the cost
efficiencies of meta-frontier and group frontier between public HELs and
private HELs, the private HELs is in a worse condition than the public
HELs of both.

III.The cost gap of public HELs(0.792) is smaller compared to private
HELs(0.995), indicates that the distance between the cost frontier of
public HELs and cost meta-frontier is greater than the private one.

IV\. As with the result for the all sample CMPG (1.027) ,it can be noted
that the CMPG is greater than 1,which means an improvement in groups
productivity and group cost frontier converges to Meta cost frontier at
the speed of 2.7%,and the group technology convergence effect mainly
comes from public HELs.

V. By decomposing the Meta-Frontier Cost Malmquist Productivity Gap
Index into two factors, both the components index,$\Delta CEG_{j}$
(1.012) and $\Delta CTG_{j}$(1.008), indicate group cost efficient
frontier converge to meta cost frontier.

VI\. When analyzing the specific group, the values of CMGP HELs in
public and private are both greater than 1, indicating the two groups
cost frontier of HELs in Taiwan converge to Meta cost frontier, showing
an improvement in cost-oriented productivity of them. The technical
efficient of public HELs of Taiwan are showing convergence at an average
speed of 7.6% ($\Delta CTG_{j}$ =1.076), whereas the private HELs shows
divergence at an average speed of 1.8% ($\Delta CTG_{j}$ =0.982).

VII.In light of the $\Delta CTG_{j}$ for HELs in Taiwan, the index of
public and private are 0.995 and 1.015.The former is less than 1,
indicating the efficiency of public HELs is facing sluggish or regress,
while the latter is greater than 1 in term of an improvement existing in
technical gap of private HELs of Taiwan.
